Ask four different pastors and you're likely to get four different answers, (i.e. \"Yes\", \"No\", \"I don't know\", \"We can't be sure.\") With Christian parents in mind, Cold Paws, Warm Heart tackles these questions from a Biblical standpoint. The answers given are illustrated with stories from the Bible, fascinating interviews and stories from several knowledgeable persons, and the author's own personal experiences with animals. \" --P.

        "description": "The use of animals by psychotherapists has been a growing trend. Psychological problems treated include emotional and behavioral problems, attachment issues, trauma, and developmental disorders. An influential 1970s survey suggests that over 20 percent of therapists in the psychotherapy division of the American Psychological Association incorporated animals into their treatment in some fashion. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the number is much higher today. Since Yeshiva psychologist Boris Levinson popularized the use of animals in the 1960s, Israel has come to be perhaps the most advanced country in the world in the area of animal-assisted psychotherapy (AAP). This is true especially in the area of training programs, theory-building, and clinical practice. Great effort has been put into understanding the mechanisms behind AAP, as well as into developing ethical guidelines that take into account the therapist's responsibility toward both client and animal. This book exposes the world to the theory and practice of AAP as conceived and used in Israel. It emphasizes evidence-based and clinically sound applications, differentiating between AAP, a psychotherapeutic approach, and AAE (animal-assisted education) and AAA (animal-assisted activities), both of which are psychoeducational. Not anyone and his/her dog can become an animal-assisted therapist, and this volume demonstrates not only the promise of animal-assisted psychotherapeutic approaches, but also some of the challenges the field still needs to overcome to gain widespread legitimacy.",

What might happen if, after the destruction of the human race, animals took over? This is a tale about the malicious murder of a few animals and the resulting chase, arrest, and prosecution of the perpetrators. It is told by an elephant to his grand calves. The story covers the murder and the investigation by Chief Inspector Bobby Bloodhound and his renowned team of detectives. They investigate the ant colonies, the beehives, the ocean, the bird sanctuary, the farm, and the wild jungle. There is a chase, a capture, and a court case to follow. Many human comparisons can be made from the behavior and actions of the animals involved.",

        "description": "The use of animals by psychotherapists has been a growing trend. Psychological problems treated include emotional and behavioral problems, attachment issues, trauma, and developmental disorders. An influential 1970s survey suggests that over 20 percent of therapists in the psychotherapy division of the American Psychological Association incorporated animals into their treatment in some fashion. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the number is much higher today. Since Yeshiva psychologist Boris Levinson popularized the use of animals in the 1960s, Israel has come to be perhaps the most advanced country in the world in the area of animal-assisted psychotherapy (AAP). This is true especially in the area of training programs, theory-building, and clinical practice. Great effort has been put into understanding the mechanisms behind AAP, as well as into developing ethical guidelines that take into account the therapist's responsibility toward both client and animal. This book exposes the world to the theory and practice of AAP as conceived and used in Israel. It emphasizes evidence-based and clinically sound applications, differentiating between AAP, a psychotherapeutic approach, and AAE (animal-assisted education) and AAA (animal-assisted activities), both of which are psychoeducational. Not anyone and his/her dog can become an animal-assisted therapist, and this volume demonstrates not only the promise of animal-assisted psychotherapeutic approaches, but also some of the challenges the field still needs to overcome to gain widespread legitimacy.",

What might happen if, after the destruction of the human race, animals took over? This is a tale about the malicious murder of a few animals and the resulting chase, arrest, and prosecution of the perpetrators. It is told by an elephant to his grand calves. The story covers the murder and the investigation by Chief Inspector Bobby Bloodhound and his renowned team of detectives. They investigate the ant colonies, the beehives, the ocean, the bird sanctuary, the farm, and the wild jungle. There is a chase, a capture, and a court case to follow. Many human comparisons can be made from the behavior and actions of the animals involved.",

        "description": "The use of animals by psychotherapists has been a growing trend. Psychological problems treated include emotional and behavioral problems, attachment issues, trauma, and developmental disorders. An influential 1970s survey suggests that over 20 percent of therapists in the psychotherapy division of the American Psychological Association incorporated animals into their treatment in some fashion. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the number is much higher today. Since Yeshiva psychologist Boris Levinson popularized the use of animals in the 1960s, Israel has come to be perhaps the most advanced country in the world in the area of animal-assisted psychotherapy (AAP). This is true especially in the area of training programs, theory-building, and clinical practice. Great effort has been put into understanding the mechanisms behind AAP, as well as into developing ethical guidelines that take into account the therapist's responsibility toward both client and animal. This book exposes the world to the theory and practice of AAP as conceived and used in Israel. It emphasizes evidence-based and clinically sound applications, differentiating between AAP, a psychotherapeutic approach, and AAE (animal-assisted education) and AAA (animal-assisted activities), both of which are psychoeducational. Not anyone and his/her dog can become an animal-assisted therapist, and this volume demonstrates not only the promise of animal-assisted psychotherapeutic approaches, but also some of the challenges the field still needs to overcome to gain widespread legitimacy.",

What might happen if, after the destruction of the human race, animals took over? This is a tale about the malicious murder of a few animals and the resulting chase, arrest, and prosecution of the perpetrators. It is told by an elephant to his grand calves. The story covers the murder and the investigation by Chief Inspector Bobby Bloodhound and his renowned team of detectives. They investigate the ant colonies, the beehives, the ocean, the bird sanctuary, the farm, and the wild jungle. There is a chase, a capture, and a court case to follow. Many human comparisons can be made from the behavior and actions of the animals involved.",
